                <h3>How the Prediction System Works</h3>
                <p>
                    The Building Structural Health Prediction system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict 
                    the structural health of buildings based on critical engineering parameters. Our prediction model has been 
                    trained on a comprehensive dataset of building properties and their observed structural health outcomes.

                                    The compressive strength of concrete significantly affects the structural integrity. 
                                    Higher grade concrete (M40, M45, M50) offers better durability and resistance to environmental factors.

                                    Available grades range from M20 (standard strength) to M50 (high strength) in our system.

                                    Seismic loads represent the forces that structures experience during earthquakes. 
                                    Buildings in higher seismic zones require more robust design considerations.

                                    Our system considers both the seismic zone (I-V) and a custom seismic load factor.

                                    The support structure significantly impacts how loads are distributed. The four main types are:

                                    <li><strong>Cantilever:</strong> Fixed at one end but free at the other, suitable for overhanging structures.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Simply Support:</strong> Both ends are free to rotate but not to translate horizontally.</li>

                <h3>Machine Learning Model</h3>
                <p>
                    Our system utilizes a Random Forest Regression algorithm, which excels at capturing complex non-linear relationships 
                    between building parameters and structural health. The model was trained on a diverse dataset of building specifications 
                    and their documented structural performance.
                </p>

                <h3>Prediction Accuracy</h3>
                <p>
                    While our predictive model provides valuable insights, it should be used as a supplementary tool rather than a replacement for 
                    professional structural assessment. The predictions are based on general engineering principles and statistical patterns, 
                    but each building has unique characteristics that might not be fully captured in the model.
